Welcome to my first ever blog.  Ever.  I feel like a flower blossoming or a butterfly emerging into the world for the first time... OK, maybe not quite...  But anyway, here goes...
I knew when I graduated college I didn't want a 'real job.'  "Office Space" cured me of any cubicle desires I may have had.  Also gave me a distaste for corporate structure.  Even though it's a parody, of course, there's some substance to be found there.  Anyway, I have spent the last twelve years avoiding 'real jobs.'  Maybe I'll keep the trend going.  But I have known for a while now that I need to do something different.  Something that I will enjoy and will be constructive.  Something pragmatic and applicable.  So I decided to hop online and check out computer coding.  I took a few Java classes in college, and there are a few things I remember through hazy memories.  But mostly I'm starting fresh checking out these online tutorials and learn-to-code come-alongs.. It turns out, this is awesome!  I can actually write code and make things work!  This is really cool.  What better skill to have than to be able to help people build and communicate ideas of all sorts through the pulsing, bustling, ever-evolving mass of information, recreation, commerce, and communication that the internet has become?!  There is something joyful about writing a few lines of code and watching it ... work!  There is something intriguing about writing a few lines of code and watching it ... not work -- but it's like a mini-detective exercise (yes, I read every "Encyclopedia Brown" and "Hardy Boys" book that exists) in trying to solve the case of the "no method" error ... or "argument error" ... or "you just did something that produced an error that has yet to be named" error ...  I have just found a medium to express myself in a whole new way.. and I'm stoked on it.
